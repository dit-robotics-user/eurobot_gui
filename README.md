# eurobot_gui

## Buttons

- Hit wall: Run hit-wall positioning.

- Start: Ready for unplugging.

## Labels

- Timer: The game time starts to display once the 'Start' button is clicked.

## Notes

- The game time will start when the plug on the robot is pulled away in later versions.

- I need MaHua's code for:
    1. score publisher
    2. plug publisher
    3. command subscriber

- There's only one thing that you need to install: Optimal C font

- Currently, the gui is for 800x600 touch display
